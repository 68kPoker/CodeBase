# Warehouse (Magazyn)

Here's a source code in C with addition of MC680x0 Assembler of my simple logic game called 
Warehouse for Amiga OS 3.0.

# Important Note (28.05.2021):

I have managed to gather 608+ source code files from this year only.
They have been put into separate directories. The next step will be to 
get the code up and running.

It consists of various interesting engine features:
- Fast and smooth animation with double-buffering and video coprocessor sync,
- Direct usage of graphics blitter coprocessor for fast drawing operations,
- Fully system, intuition environment and multitasking friendly,
- Board engine with built-in game editor,
- IFF file support for easy modifications,
- Audio channel allocation,
- High compatibility across Amiga OS.

The game also offers:
- Nice graphics,
- Attractive puzzles.
