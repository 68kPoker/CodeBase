# Warehouse (Magazyn)

Here's a source code in C with addition of MC680x0 Assembler of my simple logic game called 
Warehouse for Amiga OS 3.0.
It consists of various interesting engine features:
- Fast and smooth animation with double-buffering and video coprocessor sync,
- Direct usage of graphics blitter coprocessor for fast drawing operations,
- Fully system, intuition environment and multitasking friendly,
- Board engine with built-in game editor.

The game also offers:
- Nice graphics.
