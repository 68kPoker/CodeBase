OK, boys and girls. Here comes the Warehouse.
New game from AmiCore Software.

It features:
- Custom graphics user interface.
  It's based on intuition and BOOPSI.
  Program opens custom screen, installs Copper interrupt server, which
  sends signal to main task. The main task then switches bitmap with
  ChangeVPBitMap(). When SafeMessage appears it begins rendering to
  off-screen bitmap.
